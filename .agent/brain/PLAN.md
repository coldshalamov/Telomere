# Implementation Plan

## Goal
Verify the current state of the Telomere repo and ensure it works as intended. Resume development if needed.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Verification (Current)
- [x] Run `cargo test` (Failed).
- [ ] Fix compilation errors.
- [ ] Re-run `cargo test`.
- [ ] Build release binary.
- [ ] Run a manual round-trip compression test on a small file.

### Phase 2: Fix & Polish
- [ ] Fix any logical errors found in tests.
- [ ] Clean up code.

### Phase 3: Next Steps
- [ ] Implement "Seed-driven decoding" if incomplete.
- [ ] Optimize performance.
